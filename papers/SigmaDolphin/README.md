# SigmaDolphin

Buiding a computer system to automatically solve math word problems written in natural language. SigmaDolphin is a project initiated in early 2013 at Microsoft Research Asia, with the primary goal of building a computer intelligent system with natural language understanding and reasoning capacities. We focus on the application of automatic problem solving, i.e., automatically solving problems (especially math word problems) written in natural language.

This repository contains the open-sourced data of our collected math word problems.
